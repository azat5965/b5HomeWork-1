		 * What is for loop?
		 * 
		 * The logic of loop is to repeat or to iterate an action multiple times.
		 * for loop is one of the most common used loops to iterate an action multiple times.
		 * the syntax for for loop or declaration for forloop is as bellow:
		 * for(initialization; booleanCondition; updateStatement){body of for loop}
		 * curly braces requird for block of multiple statements.
		 * initialization part executes only once, because we iterate and update statement.
		 * as long as boolean condition is true our for loop will continue to execute.
		 * the update statement part has nothing to do with the loop body, it is only to keep record of iteration.
		 * in for loop the increment and decrement is not important whether it is pre or post. because 
		 * we use the updated condition at next iteration or next line.
		 * for loop will compile with no error even with empty syntax as long as the structure is correct but
		 * it will give error at run time. example: for( ; ; ){ } this will compile.
		 * The update statement can be in forloop declaration part inside parentheses or inside forloop body.
		 * forloop can have multiple starting points and multiple boolean conditions separated by comma.
